# Exercise-06d-Unit-Testing

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A simple example of Unit Testing, using GUT. Implements (and auto-runs) the test_example.gd suite. 2 tests should pass, and 3 should fail.

Any script (that follows the applicable conventions) in the res://test/unit or res://test/integration will be run when the project is played.

## Implementation

 - Built using Godot 3.5
 - [GUT](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) can be installed via the Asset Library or downloaded from GitHub.

## References

 - [GUT Documentation](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Quick-Start)

## Future Development

Add more tests

James Burke (not sure where else I'd get the chance to write this other than the anonymous survey through canvas, so I figured I'd put it here. Thank you so much for this semester! I am glad I took this class and was exposed to all of the content you have introduced in this class. I have learned a lot of concepts from lectures and demonstrations. The way you organize the canvas page class so well is also something I want to highlight that is also super helpful! From demonstration videos, to supplementary videos, to a clean and clear canvas page, to check-in's, I cannot thank you enough for how concise and organized you have made this class. You are an amazing professor and I love not only your class but your attitude towards teaching as well. Thank you for this semester and I hope all is well with your future career at UCD (if I remember this correctly.)
